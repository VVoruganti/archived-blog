I first got into technology and engineering when I was introduced to the world
of hackathons in high school. The idea of getting together with a community of
like-minded people who just like to tinker and sharing what everyone made
really exciting me. Where I was from I could not really just talk about stuff
I was interested in that much, so being able to share my thoughts and
experiences really blew my mind and got me hooked. 

I started going to as many hackathons as I could convince my parents to drive
me too. I was waiting for once I went to college and could really in-grain
myself into this community. But after entering college I started to notice that
the tinkerer community is a lot more diverse and divided than I thought.
Hackathons were also starting to wane from their original vibe. They became
more about the competition than the curiosity. More and more how can I make
a projects guaranteed to get the most wins and impress specific companies. I'm
no here to criticize that kind of thing, but it just what originally interested
me. I started to see little "just for fun" projects at any software
hackathon. I started returning to online for sharing and seeing expiriments and
pure hobbyist projects. 

A friend and I were talking about this one day ,and we realized there really
isn't a large community for people who tinkered with software. Now there were
hackathons nd smaller more specialized clubs, but there wasn't really just one
place to share things you've made. Most of the discussion was around how to
land a job or practicing for interviews. Definitely useful information and glad
that we talked about it, but I still wanted just wanted to share experiences
about the entire field. See I found that at Georgia Tech I did not get much out
of my classes. The school was focused primarily on research, so professors were
not incentivized to be good teachers. Most classes just felt like a series of
assignments that I had to google and self research to get through. Maybe
that's just what college is, but in high school I felt I was able to pull
a lot away from just attending my teachers' lectures.  

The engineering school had a much different situation.
