This page is inspired by [Karlicoss's exobrain](https://beepb00p.xyz/exobrain/)

I want to make a better record of who I am and the content I am interacting with.

## Reading

Currently reading: Fortune's Formula

## Want to learn

Different tech and concepts I find interesting and cool links I want to look at more. 

### Game Dev

* [Box2D tutorial](https://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/) - Struggled to find a good tutorial on this and really understand how to make a good feeling platformer
* [libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod) - Roguelike dev engine
* [Game Programming Design Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)
* [How to make a .io game](https://victorzhou.com/blog/build-an-io-game-part-1/)
* [Machinations](https://machinations.io/) - Tool to prototype game systems and economies

### Massively-concurrrent dataflow programming languages

What even are these, why they stopped being used.

* [Joule Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_(programming_language))
* [E Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(programming_language))

### Emulators and Hardware

Just interested in old hardware and why we need to emulate hardware to play ROMs

* [Fabien Sanglard](https://fabiensanglard.net/) - Really cool posts on games and hardware
* [Rodrigro Copetti Architecture of Consoles](https://www.copetti.org/)
* [MiSTer FPGA](https://www.retrorgb.com/mister.html)


### Compilers and Tree Parsers

Mainly stemming from a interest in neovim and how text editors work

* [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/index.html)
* [How to write a tree-sitter grammar in an afternoon](https://siraben.dev/2022/03/01/tree-sitter.html)

### Blockchain Development

I want to learn what I can actually create with web3 tech so I can make my own judgement on how useful I see it is. 

* [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/)
* [Kernel Community](https://www.kernel.community/en/)
* [Coin Story](https://coinstory.tech/#resources)
* [Web 3 Stack](https://edgeandnode.com/blog/defining-the-web3-stack/)
* [Crypto Reading](https://danromero.org/crypto-reading/)

### Game AI

* [Chess Engines](https://www.chessengines.org/)
* [Game AI Pro](http://www.gameaipro.com/)

## Interface Description Languages

* [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language)
* [Apache Thrift Project](https://thrift.apache.org/)
* [Imandra.ai: IPL](https://www.imandra.ai/ipl-product)

* [Buf](https://buf.build/)

## Questions I want to explore

### Climate

How is technology currently being leveraged to help with climate change. I've seen a lot of different projects around tokenizing carbon credits, carbon sink technology, advocacy, but want to get more of an understanding of the landscape and the current impact it is having.

Some links I'm looking at 

* [Climatebase](https://climatebase.org/) - list of companies and jobs in the climate space
* [Crypto Climate Accord](https://cryptoclimate.org/accord/) - A sorta manifesto about how web3 companies can help with the climate crisis
* [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/) - Another (rival?) group of web3 organizations trying to help curtail the climate crisis.
