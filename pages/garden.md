meta_description: Second brain record of what I'm currently thinking about

This page is inspired by [Karlicoss's exobrain](https://beepb00p.xyz/exobrain/)

I want to make a better record of who I am, and the content I am interacting
with. Eventually want to consolidate my bookmarks to make something like
[Nikiv.dev's Wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/)

# Reading

Currently reading: Dawn of Yangchen by F. C. Yee

# Want to learn

Different tech and concepts I find interesting and cool links I want to look at more.

## Game Dev

I just think games and their development are the coolest things. I find myself
watching a lot of [Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/extracredits) and [Game Maker's
Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK) videos. 

Below are a few different tutorials and concepts I've been meaning to dive into

- [Box2D tutorial](https://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/) — Struggled to find a good tutorial on this and really understand how to make a good feeling platformer
- [libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod) — Roguelike dev engine
- [Game Programming Design Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)
- [How to make a .io game](https://victorzhou.com/blog/build-an-io-game-part-1/)
- [Machinations](https://machinations.io/) — Tool to prototype game systems and economies
- [How to make an RPG](https://howtomakeanrpg.com/)
- [BYTEPATH Tutorial](https://github.com/a327ex/blog/issues/30) — A really nice
  all encompassing tutorial for a Love2D game

## Petal Stack

I'm getting pretty tired of the NodeJS ecosystem and have been reading a lot
about rails and why people really liked it back in the day. After working on a
couple of projects where I had to figure out a ton of stuff like auth myself
along with issues between client side vs server side code the opiniated all
inclusive stack seems really appealing. Elxir + Pheonix + Liveview seems to be
the modern successor in a lot of ways to rails.

Additionally, I've been reading a lot of the [fly.io](https://fly.io/) blog
posts, and they talk about elixir a lot, which fly being a great platform for
running it. As a fan of fly, and it being the place where I want to host a lot of
projects in the future I want to dive more into it. 

## Massively concurrrent dataflow programming languages

What even are these, why they stopped being used.

- [Joule Programming Language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_(programming_language)>)
- [E Programming Language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(programming_language)>)

## Emulators and Hardware

Just interested in old hardware and why we need to emulate hardware to play ROMs

- [Fabien Sanglard](https://fabiensanglard.net/) — Really cool posts on games and hardware
- [Rodrigro Copetti Architecture of Consoles](https://www.copetti.org/)
- [MiSTer FPGA](https://www.retrorgb.com/mister.html)

## Compilers and Tree Parsers

Mainly stemming from a interest in neovim and how text editors work

- [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/index.html)
- [How to write a tree-sitter grammar in an afternoon](https://siraben.dev/2022/03/01/tree-sitter.html)
- [Let's Build a Compiler](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/)
- [From Source Code to Machine Code](https://build-your-own.org/#section-compiler)

## Game AI

- [Chess Engines](https://www.chessengines.org/)
- [Game AI Pro](http://www.gameaipro.com/)

## Interface Description Languages

- [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language)
- [Apache Thrift Project](https://thrift.apache.org/)
- [Imandra.ai: IPL](https://www.imandra.ai/ipl-product)

## Protocol Engineering

This comes from looking at a lot of different blockchain projects and noticing
that the base for many of them aren't a coin but rather a common protocol. I
think my interest in this started back when I discovered [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) before I found
[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf). Then after learning a bit about how a DAO works through sart contracts
I was wondering what else you could do by design domain specific protocols.

- Could you maybe design an entire set of laws and decision making using a DAO
protocol
  - For example could you codify Robert's Rules of Order into a protocol that
  you could then deploy as an instance of a "deliberative assembly"
- Also interested in this domain from the space of networking protocols. For the
most part, the different protocols I've seen are fundamentally based on TCP and UDP.
So how can you go about designing your own protocol for specific needs?

# Questions I want to explore

## Financial Infrastructure

These questions stem from some the work I was doing with
[plain-text-accounting](../2022/plain-text-accounting) and trying to understand
why it's so hard to get my own financial data, and it's a bit two-pronged in terms
of what I want to know. First, I want to understand a bit more of creating my
own personal finance stack. This includes the budgeting work I've done, but also
stuff such as owning my own bank and investments. Some related platforms I was
looking at. 

- [Column Developer Bank](https://column.com/)
- [Composer no-code investment workflows](https://www.composer.trade/) 
- [Alpaca algotrading](https://alpaca.markets/) 
- [Bare Metal Bank Increase](https://increase.com/)

The other idea I was thinking about is what is the actual technology that is at
the backbones of the US or current world financial system. How does the stock
exchange work? I know how a lot of decentralized or centralized exchanges in the
web3 world work, but I don't fully understand the current stock exchange. If
it's an exchange why I can trade on it directly? Wanted to frame this as if I
was starting a new country how would I build a financial system. 

- [Electronic Data Interchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange)
- [Fednow](https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow)

## Climate

How is technology being leveraged to help with climate change. I've seen a lot of different
projects around tokenizing carbon credits, carbon sink technology, advocacy, but want to get more of an
understanding of the landscape, and the current impact it is having.

Some links I'm looking at

- [Climatebase](https://climatebase.org/) — list of companies and jobs in the climate space
- [Crypto Climate Accord](https://cryptoclimate.org/accord/) — A sorta manifesto about how web3 companies can help with the climate crisis
- [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/) — Another (rival?) group of web3 organizations trying to help curtail the climate crisis.
