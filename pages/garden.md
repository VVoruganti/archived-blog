This page is inspired by [Karlicoss's exobrain](https://beepb00p.xyz/exobrain/)

I want to make a better record of who I am and the content I am interacting with.

# Want to learn

Different tech and concepts I find interesting and cool links I want to look at more.

## Game Dev

- [Box2D tutorial](https://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/) -- Struggled to find a good tutorial on this and really understand how to make a good feeling platformer
- [libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod) --- Roguelike dev engine
- [Game Programming Design Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)
- [How to make a .io game](https://victorzhou.com/blog/build-an-io-game-part-1/)
- [Machinations](https://machinations.io/) --- Tool to prototype game systems and economies

## Massively concurrrent dataflow programming languages

What even are these, why they stopped being used.

- [Joule Programming Language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_(programming_language)>)
- [E Programming Language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(programming_language)>)

## Emulators and Hardware

Just interested in old hardware and why we need to emulate hardware to play ROMs

- [Fabien Sanglard](https://fabiensanglard.net/) - Really cool posts on games and hardware
- [Rodrigro Copetti Architecture of Consoles](https://www.copetti.org/)
- [MiSTer FPGA](https://www.retrorgb.com/mister.html)

## Compilers and Tree Parsers

Mainly stemming from a interest in neovim and how text editors work

- [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/index.html)
- [How to write a tree-sitter grammar in an afternoon](https://siraben.dev/2022/03/01/tree-sitter.html)

## Blockchain Development

I want to learn what I can actually create with web3 tech so I can make my own judgement on how useful I see it is.

- [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/)
- [Kernel Community](https://www.kernel.community/en/)
- [Coin Story](https://coinstory.tech/#resources)
- [Web 3 Stack](https://edgeandnode.com/blog/defining-the-web3-stack/)
- [Crypto Reading](https://danromero.org/crypto-reading/)

## Game AI

- [Chess Engines](https://www.chessengines.org/)
- [Game AI Pro](http://www.gameaipro.com/)

## Interface Description Languages

- [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language)
- [Apache Thrift Project](https://thrift.apache.org/)
- [Imandra.ai: IPL](https://www.imandra.ai/ipl-product)
- [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
- [Buf](https://buf.build/)

## Protocol Engineering

This comes from looking at a lot of different blockchain projects and noticing
that the base for many of them aren't a coin but rather a common protocol. I
think my interest in this started back when I discovered [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) before I found
[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf). Then after learning a bit about how a DAO works through sart contracts
I was wondering what else you could do by design domain specific protocols.

- Could you maybe design an entire set of laws and decision making using a DAO
protocol
  - For example could you codify Robert's Rules of Order into a protocol that
  you could then deploy as an instance of a "deliberative assembly"
- Also interested in this domain from the space of networking protocols. For the
most part, the different protocols I've seen are fundamentally based on TCP and UDP.
So how can you go about designing your own protocol for specific needs?

# Questions I want to explore

## Financial Infrastructure

These questions stem from some the work I was doing with
[plain-text-accounting](../2022/plain-text-accounting) and trying to understand
why its so hard to get my own financial data and its a bit two-pronged in terms
of what I want to know. First, I want to understand a bit more of creating my
own personal finance stack. This includes the budgeting work I've done, but also
stuff such as owning my own bank and investments. Some related platforms I was
looking at. 

- [Column Developer Bank](https://column.com/)
- [Composer no-code investment workflows](https://www.composer.trade/) 
- [Alpaca algotrading](https://alpaca.markets/) 
- [Bare Metal Bank Increase](https://increase.com/)

The other idea I was thinking about is what is the actual technology that is at
the backbones of the US or current world financial system. How does the stock
exchange work? I know how a lot of decentralized or centralized exchanges in the
web3 world work, but I don't fully understand the current stock exchange. If
it's an exchange why I can trade on it directly? Wanted to frame this as if I
was starting a new country how would I build a financial system.

- [Fednow](https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow)

## Climate

How is technology being leveraged to help with climate change. I've seen a lot of different
projects around tokenizing carbon credits, carbon sink technology, advocacy, but want to get more of an
understanding of the landscape and the current impact it is having.

Some links I'm looking at

- [Climatebase](https://climatebase.org/) - list of companies and jobs in the climate space
- [Crypto Climate Accord](https://cryptoclimate.org/accord/) - A sorta manifesto about how web3 companies can help with the climate crisis
- [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/) - Another (rival?) group of web3 organizations trying to help curtail the climate crisis.
