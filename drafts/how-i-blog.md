<!-- Excerpt Start -->
Since that [last post](/posts/2022/why-i-blog) there have been a lot of changes
in how my blog has been looking. Originally i was using [bearblog](https://bearblog.dev)
but since then their terms and conditions changed. 

I didn't like their new system and I finally had a large amount of freetime so
I decided that I would invest a meaningful amount of time into creating a style
and workflow that I like.
